# Assignment-2

This project involved the creation of twelve JavaScript functions that recreate popular methods, including:

- forEach
-	Map
-	Filter
-	Some (Any)
-	Every
-	Reduce
-	Includes
-	indexOf
-	Push
-	lastIndexOf
-	Object.keys()
-	Object.values()

Additionally, functions were implemented to find the sum of a range of values, as well as reverse an array.
